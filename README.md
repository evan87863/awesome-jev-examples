# Awesome Jev Examples

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md) · [Español](README.es.md)

> Discover what people build with Jev, how it works, and where to learn more.

A curated index for **[TypeSafe AI’s Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction)**, a decision model that answers Choice, Score, and Noul questions over supplied state. Independent community project; not affiliated with TypeSafe AI.

[Getting started](docs/START-HERE.md) · [All details](catalog/DETAILS.md) · [X / YouTube](catalog/MEDIA.md) · [Contributing (English)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**72 resources:** 46 source-code projects/SDKs, 25 official guides/patterns/references, and 1 first-party engineering report. **28 additional X / YouTube leads** await review. Initial review: 2026-09-19.

Review means reading the stated source, not running or auditing the project. No examples have been reproduced here. Two official pages were only partially retrieved and are marked accordingly. Author-reported performance is not independently verified.

## Ways to use Jev

Choose the entry point that fits your workflow. The first four are official TypeSafe entry points; OpenRouter is a third-party model platform, and AIJev is an independent community demo.

- **[Playground](https://console.typesafe.ai/playground)** — Try Choice, Score, and Noul together in the browser—no local setup required. [Open Playground](https://console.typesafe.ai/playground).
- **[HTTP API](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api)** — Send `state`, `model`, and typed `questions` to `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`. Check the current schema before integrating. [API reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api).
- **[Python SDK](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python)** — Run `pip install typesafe-sdk` for typed sync or async calls; the client reads `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the environment. [Python SDK guide](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python).
- **[Agent Skill](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/skills)** — Run `npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai` so coding agents can design requests, batch independent questions, and interpret typed answers. [Official skill](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/skills).
- **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe)** — Call Jev through OpenRouter’s API or Jev Lab. Its current always-latest model ID is `~typesafe/jev-latest`. [OpenRouter models](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe).
- **[AIJev playground](https://aijev.net)** — Explore the three decision types through an independent third-party demo. Its behavior is not evidence of the official service’s performance. [Open AIJev](https://aijev.net).

For direct TypeSafe access, create an API key in the [TypeSafe console](https://console.typesafe.ai/settings/keys). Provider access, pricing, model IDs, and installation commands can change; follow the linked source when you integrate.

- **[Kill My Idea](https://github.com/monteduro/killmyidea)** — Ask parallel questions about a startup idea and combine scores into a fixed verdict. [Details](catalog/DETAILS.md#monteduro--killmyidea)
- **[neo4jev](https://github.com/jexp/neo4jev)** — Choose the next graph relationship and check whether the goal is reached in the same call. [Details](catalog/DETAILS.md#jexp--neo4jev)
- **[Janus](https://github.com/FirasSX914/Janus)** — Measure when to route between small and large models, including when routing should be rejected. [Details](catalog/DETAILS.md#firassx914--janus)
